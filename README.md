// (Description) - Website about Ichigo Kurosaki. Every Page should have a NavBar. The landing page should have a button to instantly learn more about Ichigo. Clicking on the logo will return you back to the landing page. Website should have a Landing, Interest, About Me, and Accomplishments page. 
// Peer Review Zachary Dressel: Figma and Finished website line up save for the Home button on the NavBar, all buttons work properly, everything is spaced properly on my computer as well. Site text changes to match reduced pixel size.
Overall great! I'm biased though because I like bleach but beyond that, great!
